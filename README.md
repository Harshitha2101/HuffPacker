# HuffPacker
Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that reduces the size of data by encoding it with variable-length codes based on the frequency of each character. The process involves creating a Huffman tree, encoding the data, and then decoding it.

How to compile and run: gcc encode.cpp ./a.out gcc decode.cpp ./a.out gcc compression.cpp ./a.out gcc compare.cpp ./a.out

Respective files would be created like huffmancode file, encoded file and decoded file and %compression.
